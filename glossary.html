        <p><b>Neural Network:</b> An artificial intelligence technique that enables computers to process data in a manner inspired by the human brain </p>
        <p><b>Gass Emissions:</b> Emissions constitute substances discharged into the atmosphere, their quantification is based on concentrations, typically expressed as parts per million.</p>
        <p><b>Data Utilization:</b> Utilizing data consistently to attain enhanced business results, such as increased productivity and profitability.</p>
        <p><b>Extensive Datasets:</b> What constitutes a large dataset is dependent on aspects such as warehouse size, the use case, and the intended workbook load time or performance. Often datasets that require performance to be improved are 100+ million rows, or have more than 30 columns.</p>
        <p><b>Web of Interrelated Nodes:</b> A set of nodes forms a connected component in an undirected graph if any node from the set of nodes can reach any other node by traversing edges.</p>
        <p><b>Computational Resources:</b> Both hardware and software components of infrastructure that facilitate problem-solving and the generation of solutions by receiving, analyzing, and storing data</p>
        <p><b>GPUs and TPUs:</b>GPU is an abbreviation for graphics processing unit.Initially intended for enhancing 3D graphics tasks such as video rendering, GPUs have gained widespread popularity in the field of AI due to their parallel computing capability.       
            TPU, short for tensor processing unit, serves as a specialized architecture tailored for deep learning and machine learning purposes.
            Conceived by Google, TPUs represent application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) meticulously crafted to address the computational requirements of machine learning, thereby expediting AI calculations and algorithms
        </p>
        <p><b>Carbon Footprint:</b> A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions. </p>
